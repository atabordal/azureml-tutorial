    "# Tutorial #2:  Deploy a ML model in Azure Container Instance (ACI)\n",

    "This tutorial is **part two of a two-part tutorial series**. In the previous tutorial, you trained machine learning models and then registered a model in your workspace on the cloud.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you're ready to deploy the model as a web service in [Azure Container Instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-instances/) (ACI). A web service is an image, in this case a Docker image, that encapsulates the scoring logic and the model itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the tutorial, you use Azure Machine Learning service (Preview) to:\n",
    "\n",
    "> * Set up your testing environment\n",
    "> * Retrieve the model from your workspace\n",
    "> * Test the model locally\n",
    "> * Deploy the model to ACI\n",
    "> * Test the deployed model\n",
    "\n",
    "ACI is a great solution for testing and understanding the workflow. For scalable production deployments, consider using Azure Kubernetes Service. For more information, see [how to deploy and where](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-deploy-and-where).\n"
